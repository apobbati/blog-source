I'm Abhinav Pobbati, and I am a Technical Consultant living in Washington D.C.

I also happen to run a consulting firm [CodeBlock Inc.](http://codeblock.io/) that specializes
in architecting cloud-native applications and making legacy application migration to the cloud a
possibility for enterprises.
